/*!
 * \brief The DataSinkDelegate interface is implemented by classes that save
 * the data flowing through the pipeline to disk.
 *
 * A DataSinkDelegate can save data at any point in the pipeline â€” raw bytes,
 * Sample%s, FeatureVector%s, and CognitiveState. Note, however, that any given
 * DataSinkDelegate implementation does not necessarily support saving all of
 * these types of data; if you try to save an unsupported data type a warning
 * will be logged at runtime.
 *
 * Associated with a DataSinkDelegate is the concept of \e "capture info".
 * This allows DataSinkDelegate implementations to store arbitrary metadata
 * alongside the saved data. For more details, see getCaptureInfo() and
 * needsNewCaptureInfo().
