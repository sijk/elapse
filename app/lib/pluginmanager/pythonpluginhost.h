 * \brief The PythonHost class loads plugins implemented in Python.
 *
 * The PythonHost internally launches a Python interpreter which is used
 * to load Python plugins. A plugin is a Python package containing one or
 * more subclasses of elapse::elements decorated with `@elapse.export`.
 *
 * \note Python plugins must be packages, not modules â€” i.e.
 * \c "foo/__init__.py" not \c "foo.py".
